## Applications

Hi, this is my submission for personio test. This is an app to list a series of applications to different roles at personio. This list consumes an api(that can fail from time to time) and enables the user to sort by any field, and also to make some basic filtering on the columns

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.


### Installing

Checkout the project, and on its root folder run


```
yarn install
```
or 

```
npm i
```

When the installation finishes you sould be able to run the development server using

```
yarn start
```
or 
```
npm run start
```
It will open you a browser tab pointing to http://localhost:3000
